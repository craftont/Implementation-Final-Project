# Integration Testing for Classics Theater Website

## Overview
Integration testing evaluates the Classics Theater website as a combined system to ensure different parts work together as expected. This stage follows unit testing and involves testing the interaction between connected modules.

## Testing Approach

### Tools Used
- **Selenium**: For automating web browsers to test interactions between components.
- **Postman**: To test API interactions if any backend services are used.

### Scenarios Tested
- **End-to-End Booking Flow**: Tests the complete flow from selecting a movie to submitting a booking.
- **Data Integration**: Ensures that movie data loaded on one page correctly passes to subsequent pages like showings and booking.
- **Navigation**: Verifies that links between pages correctly redirect users and maintain necessary state information.

### Execution
1. Setup Selenium with the required drivers for your browser.
2. Create test scripts that simulate user actions from starting the app to final confirmation.
3. Run the tests using Selenium's test runner and observe the results.

### Test Environment
- Set up a staging environment that closely mimics the production setup to conduct the integration tests.

## Conclusion
Integration testing verifies that the Classics Theater website components function cohesively, providing a seamless user experience from start to finish.
